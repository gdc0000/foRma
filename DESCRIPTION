Description: Provides tools for visualizing Structural Equation Models (SEM) using AI-generated layouts. The package integrates with the lavaan package and uses Google's Gemini API to create optimized, publication-quality SEM plots. It offers both static ggplot2 visualizations with APA-style formatting and interactive visNetwork widgets for exploration. The AI-powered layout algorithm automatically positions nodes based on causal flow, making complex models easier to understand and present.
